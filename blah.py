Hello
This is Matt
This is Helena
And this is the me the first episode of hammock shots
And I'm here with the co-founder of the idea Helena
And this is going to be she's going to be the first guest for the week
And essentially would have a chance is is that it's a way to just like
Sit on Jan's relax and
I guess
Reflect on life
But guess every week just to
As A Memoir of how
However it's feeling
The current moment
Any thought
I'm very excited to be your first guest
You know we should set the scene for our
Like they can't
See what we see
Like today is such a wonderful day outside the weather is
It's talk
And you know everyone has their
Like people are sunnating loun
To like
We're like kind of on the
Side of it all
To watch
They're over like little world and like little like
You know
From an Outsiders
Perspective
Like doing their own
It's like really
To watch exactly right now to set the scene it's a nice sunny day in Los Angeles
February 10
And
Sitting on like I guess the right side of Jen's
You can just
Potentially see
What everyone's just doing on the lawn
There's people just
Literally just sitting in sunbathing some some shirtless guys just like
Out there might be their own business tanning
But she was just studying like
Honestly
It's a good vibe have you ever worked out here before Helena
I have you know
Here I actually used to come
Get to Jan's a lot
And right now in the apartment life
Don't do as
Much but I want
Like a golf
Like maybe next
This quarter when the weather
To come out here more you know bring a blanket I have
Kids at home in like invite some
To come and
Yeah
I know originally you wanted to send babe today but
Unfortunately
We are in the shade but honestly
I think I'm kind of I kind of prefer the shade cuz like just walking here alone I was already sweating man it was like it was
See that's the perfect segue into our first
Topic of discussion
And today not because
That made us think of like
How
Kind of different we are as Californians growing SOC
Versus NorCal
Yes personally as a silicon native
I don't feel hot at all like I did not even break
Just sweat on the walk here
But on the walk here my Express several times about how hot it
Yeah I guess it's because for me
I think a big problem with me is that like
For me there's a
A big
Point of
Like no such a small area of where I feel truly comfortable
The weather and for me that's like
Anywhere outside the range I got too hot or too cold
And honestly I think that's a big reason why I really
Going to Los Angeles
Like UCLA specifically because in Westwood
We're in West Los Angeles
Windows right so close to the
And when I grew up in the East Bay Area
Honestly
Like sure it definitely the weather
Was not great but I think that the weather here in Los Angeles on a normal day
Is always better
Yeah I'm going to have to agree in terms of stuff how are his NorCal so called definitely takes a cake with weather
I think especially grabbing an Orange County where it's known for like
Each living and Coastal life like even on like December
You know
It could be even like on Christmas it was the wonderful wonderful 80 degrees you know hit the beach no matter what time
Whatever it is and I think that's this kind of weather is when you can really like
Enjoy all of like the Landscapes that California has to offer
Dante
Nice day and it has a really nice
Which I really like
Yeah I think especially something I was at this quarter
I'm not sure if it's just so calendar but
I feel like the weather here is like there's been so much rain recently and I still think I
I think I just didn't
Experience much
Growing up because I growing up
In the Bay Area I was in a suburban area with a lot of hills
So there's a lot of dirt those around us
The problem was
They were always brown and yellow cuz
It just wasn't like
I don't know I
Didn't rain enough
Like growing up were you in an area with like
A lot of Urban Air places was there a lot of wildlife nearby
See it like that's the thing about Irvine is that in the past
Two decades I feel like
There's
Such a trans
Patient with the
Like growing
Open Irvine I live
My whole life you know as long as I
And as a child
Super super Suburban
You know
For example like when I say I'm from Irvine now everyone knows like
Do you live by like the Spectrum Irvine Spectrum
Huge ball in
That is kind of like a landmark
For the city
And growing up like that place
Completely deserted no one ever went there
You know it was very very
Quiet
And
I think
Now when people think it provides they think of it as like the next urban area if you are driving
From like Los Angeles
San Diego
Most people
Make a stop in Irvine
And I think that's really credited
You like specifically
The infrastructure that they built in Irvine in the strong like
Community
Now when you look at Irvine it's like
An area known for
Some really really great business
Like food and culture and diversity
So it's really
Cool
To have lived in the city that has undergone like such a rapid
Information
You know even though I do really love living out here in Los Angeles and
Like I'm really
Racing the AL
Lifestyle Irvine will always be
Like home and I'm really proud to
I think like honestly growing up
I like how you brought up that like you saw just a rapid
Transformation of your area because I think
For both my speaker both of us when I say that
Despite living in different parts of California we are raised in the same area as in
I like with respect to we were an air that was just blossoming and growing cuz like I know you said later before
Our house you are the first batch of your high school right
And for me but it is that I was the first ever batch for the elementary school in my area when I grew in
And like just seeing the area flourish around and I think
What it was that is that like it's the difference between
When you think about old money versus new money I guess our old people versus new people
Because like in the old part of my area
The way that it is is that there's like
The white area of San Ramon and there's the Asian area
Right Irvine's like the same way
Yeah and for me I think what it is is that
In the Asian area
Like being in a just giant bubble because I think something that always bring up when I talk to people about my hometown is that
It was so interesting how we were at like a 80% Asian demographic which is like I feel like almost unheard of
Other parts of America
And I think that growing up and going here to UCLA
I think like
Definitely
I enjoy having
Like this sense of diversity as well cuz something that I also thought about was that if I went to another school
Like another school I was thinking about was Notre Dame and that had
Yeah
I think like that just speaks to like how
Lucky we are to grow up in
I diverse area where we kind of like
Accepted for Who We Are
Because now
Have the same
And even me
The East Asian us
Southeast Asian art experienc
So
I was just curious like
When you eventually ceremony being a bubble
People actually call it the bubble because
They call it like a bubble in
Fine too
Yes
I know that like we're on the same page I feel like we're
Pretty much speaking of pretty similar experiences because I know that
Recipe from San Ramon and like Doherty Valley High School in particularly they're like
Oh that's cool like it has a reputation for being like
Really
Posh area with a bunch of like
People who are super uptight and about like grades and life in school
And I guess
Made my school kind of has that cuz I know like the year before my year
There is about 70 80 people that like got into Berkeley and then we were like we made the news about it but being like a
Wow I don't know
Maybe we're not
So
Threatening you
I thought you got to
Ohio I have a friend of Ohio David ever listen to this maybe we should talk about that kind of upbring I feel like that would be very different
Thing
Yeah but I think that's that's a good thing as well because like
It sees that even though you might have
Different I'll bring a circumstances I feel like
At
Core
Every argument
Everyone can find something to
I think that's super
That's super
I think this is also
When you also talked about like how you felt
Accepted and acceptance growing up in your area I think that's a good segue into another topic which is about
Personal headspace and
How are you doing right now
Let's see Elena it's
Five of winter quarter
How how are you feeling is the worst quarter
There's not that much break you pretty much
Like enjoy the 10 weeks
Get through
In terms of
Week 5 burnout and that kind of like
Let me turn something that everyone feels I feel pretty good right now
I will say like this
Quarter
You know I'll call myself a stem girly
But
I've only taken like one stem class
I'm taking like
Humanities courses
And I guess it's what I really like about
UCLA is like being able to
These classes in like
Other subjects which kind of has broadened my
I think it's definitely supplemented my
Education but
It's definitely also like
Like understand
Culture and
Right now
Like Chinese I'm taking Communications
Psychology all of
Things that are going to
Supplement like my real world
And I thought to say that
I just not helping me
Real life
You know
But you know I feel pretty good
You know definitely better than than how I was feeling last winter quarter which we were like online for 4 weeks and then thrown into like
This are like in person thing again so
Yeah I think I feel pretty good I
How to midterm this week I did pretty well on it
This week it
She finished it like
A week early
Pretty proud of myself
And next week I have
My Chinese mid
Which Jeremy if you're listening to this
We have to do a group skit in front of the class and I'm likely generally scared for my life
If
But it did not leave your next we got to start
Be tough but
I feel pretty good and at the end of it all I'm going to reward myself
By going to the
The Korean spa
That's that seems good I feel like you've been on top of your
This week I know
I've been on my grind like
Anyone that sees me is like I'm like typing with the computer
That's honestly good because I feel like if you've been on top of everything I feel like I have been
On the opposite end of the spectrum as you know him I turn my homework in I use two late days to run homework do last night
Or it wasn't you last night it was actually due
Wednesday night
And as you're speaking right now it is Friday
And that was I did finish
But I turned it in
So
If you turn it in more than 24 hours late it
This is two days late
I turned it in 23 hours 56 minutes
And I realized on my PDF I forgot to concatenate like the last
Ipin
So then it counted
Turn in I like the
So I had I had to spend more
And it was
Unfortunate but at least there's no credit
Yeah I think like
You should be proud of yourself that you did it because I know like
How tough
The work that
We're doing
Is
And like you should be a
How do you spell just for like
I feel like we don't reward ourself
Yes I feel like right now you're like Focus
Kissing on like
I'm late but
You didn't Focus
Focus on the fact that this is like the hardest assignment of the year or like
Or of the quarter
And not like you were able to get it done on your own
According to because like
Oh yeah so
Speaking on that note there's actually two different assignments had this week other one is any any CS Majors listing here if you
You have egged for 131 and take homework two with grammars
That's known for being the hardest assignment
In a CS curriculum and
I can definitely attest to that literally everyone I know has spent sleepless nights working on it but I think at the end of the day
Like it's almost always important just to like
Reflecting me like hey
I
Especially cuz
There's some people out there I know you're listening to this because I've talked to some of you
About those who
Like
Cheap or look online for things and
I think personally
That ruins the sense of accomplishment you get
From doing something
No I totally
I think like
Right now or I think like
And if I were to talk to like my freshman self or even like my sophomore self
I cared so much about just getting it done like
I was on
Like online forms like searching for like
You know tutorials and stuff but I wasn't really like
Teaching myself the material
And you know
I think
Now as I can
Making upper div
In classes
Like I really understand the value
You an understanding
Concept that was
Because especially like when it comes around to like
Especially internship grind
Like getting a job
You have to be able to apply
The concepts and the whole point
Are these home
Is to like help
So
Yeah I think you should be proud of yourself for doing it and doing it with like 100%
Honesty because
At the end of the day
Most important thing no
Before you get exactly
Thank you
And yeah I think another thing is well that I realized like going back
To the topic of headspace
I like to think that
My social battery does not get drained very often
I can probably count
I'm on my hands the number of times I felt drained
But definitely
Like as soon as I finish that homework
I definitely felt
Like I just didn't want to do anything I was like man
I just want to just sit in here and do nothing and that's honestly surprising for me because
As someone who likes to think of this other extroverted
I normally feel that like
I retired my social battery by talking to other people
And I definitely feel like in most cases that's definitely true
But I think like
Just the combination of like
Sleepless nights
As well as
Just high pressure high stakes high stress
I think that's sort of broke me inside
Like what do you do to a wine down later
Yeah you know I think I'm exactly like the same way as you like almost every time I feel like we're very similar
The sense that
In the mindset of like you know if we finish XYZ will reward ourselves by going out with our friends
You know what I mean but that's not everyone
Things like
Way of rewarding themselves quote on quote
Or like
Spending their free time I know a lot of people who like
You know after they finish a long day of
All they want
What kind of sit by themselves and like do self-
And like I think that's
Time to time but
I think I'm definitely with you
In the sense
Like I get a ton of energy out of
Hanging out with my friends and being
Hang with people that I actually
Connect with
I think it's a totally different scenario if I was like okay I'm going to go and hang out
How much people I've never met before that's like a different type of
Energy for me
Like for me it has to be like
Someone that I know that I can
Am I connect with
And I know that I'm going to
Going to enjoy
Yeah I think that that's a really important point about like
When you are like
Making relations with people I feel like you should strengthen them by
Doing them with people who I feel like
Also
Want to be in your company because I think for me there's no worse feeling than
When you want to hang out with someone they say yes
And it's clear as day that they do not want to hang out with you
Like I feel like
At the very
For me at least whenever someone does that
It makes me feel like
I'm the problem I like is there something wrong with me or do they am I not worth someone's time
And I feel that like
For me I never want to make people feel that way I feel like
What's the most important but it's super hard
Especially for people in college when like we're starting people is the ability to say no
Yeah I think like coming to college in like suddenly you have this
Like large
Influx of freedom
Like I specially like I know from what you told me like it it's like you had like an overwhelming am
The freedom here then like what you are typically
That like
We just want to say yes to everything
Like you know it's like
Wow like all of this opportunity like I don't need to
You know I can just
Go and hang out with my friends like I don't need to
Like prearrange anything like I don't need
My parents were permission like I did when
I was in high school
Like XYZ
That we forget how to
I know and I think that's something that I
Like really learn in the past year
UCL
Like
I feel a lot more
Comfortable just saying like
Like no two
For example like
My friend
And asked me to
To hang out
And I was like okay
And
I didn't know that they were going to
Bringing over like people that
I didn't really know or like didn't really connect with until I kind of last minute but I felt
Kind of weird like saying no and it was like not really that good of an experience I hate
Like I didn't really have that good of a time but I think that's also like a learning experience like next time that happens to me like I think I feel prepared to
Say no and like that's been a really really
Large learning
Experience for me at least I usually outside of like academ
Yeah I think like
A big part of it is just like
Learning these sort of like
Not social cues but just like learning these
Social skills I feel because for me personally growing up like
I never really felt close people in high school
And the problem with that I feel like
When you're surrounded by these people for so long in college
It's like
It's just completely it was a complete different 180 for me and I feel like
Honestly
It was so weird because I think definitely like
At the start of every quarter after like having a long time out from people
I always feel like the sense of social anxiety
And I don't know why I like
Because I do enjoy meeting people and like seeing friends but at the same time it's always just interfering me being like
Man what if
Am I am I good enough to be someone's friend do they want to spend time with me
And I feel like it's just something that
I learned how to overcome
Yeah
I mean
Well that's tea
I feel like you told you like talk to me a lot about this and like the past
I think it's kind of like SP
Like
Mental review
Of
Maybe I feel similarly to you
I mean
I've kind of
Been in that situation where like that person that I asked to hang out with wasn't really
Interested to hang out with me but
They just kind of said yes but then like I kind of turned it back on myself and I think about the times that like
I didn't really want to hang out with the person but I just said yes because
Because you know maybe I was just not ready to say no like I didn't feel
I felt like maybe I'll be like damaging our relationship if I said no
And like you kind of think of like this
My cost
Of
Like
Rejecting someone
Or making
Doesn't feel like a certain way so
I think it takes like
A level of empathy
And understanding
On both part
Yeah I think it's actually really interesting that you bring up like
This feeling of
It's hard to I guess
Reject or say no to people
Because I know that like
With Valentine's Day around the corner I know that something that people
Like I've talked about is that like
If you were to like
Tell someone
That like you like them in that way
They like some people are of the camp that it puts too much pressure on them to be
Upfront about it
And how
Like you kind of pressure someone into saying like a yes or no answer
And how a lot of people actually
What they prefer
Is that
They prefer having it so that like
The idea behind flirting and flirtation is
The
Concept of deniable plausibility
Have you heard of that
No I actually have
Okay so what they mean by like deniable
Plausibility
Is how like you try to
Up like the level of like
Of communication them whether that be like through contact or whether that be like through
I know what other
As you can tell I'm not much of a flirt or so I don't know like what to say with regards to this but
Like
It's a small things you do
Which can express interest
But can also be
Just seen as signs of being a friend and seeing if people match that same level
And then like that kind of brings up like this
The second
Like the follow-up
Then like
Do you think that taking it from like
Inside the next level
Like relationship
Then like what is that going to take
That's that's a good question and honestly I don't know the answer to that because as someone who's never dated
Before I I personally don't know it I think I'm still trying to find out as well like
It's like what do you think your thoughts are then because like I feel like
I saw it was in a relationship you probably know this better than I would
Well even at 7:00 that's
It's like dated before I feel like no one really has
Like
I think in order to like
To find an answer to this you would have to
Seek out some sort of like relationship
Expert which doesn't really exist
Or someone
Like everyone
I don't really think like for example I don't really
Think anyone
When could really
Like give an
And here's why
Like look at all these people out here
Hey what are the OD
Thought like
Someone here has
The love of their life they're like married okay like we're looking at a bunch of college students by the way like not a single person here could tell you the answer
All these
Have been in like probably
You know relationships that have not
Succeeded
You know even late in life people end up
Divorcing or like ending their relationships because
Years and years and years down the line it doesn't work out
So maybe there's no like
See I think that's kind of what gives me peace of mind is knowing that there's no right formula there's no way to do
Relationships and love correctly as twice as
Or twice doesn't say there is no formula of love
Yeah I think
That's actually interesting because like I know how you say that like
No one can give
One right answer which is why well I could use that I like to consult with people on
Their thoughts are things because I feel like for me
I don't know if it's external validation but I just like
Hearing other people's perspectives
One problem because I feel like
Sometimes
The best way to look at something is from a fresh pair of eyes
Right
My eyes are not fresh they are age I have a stigmatism
Yeah that's why I like I don't send my friends
They're saying how oh maybe you should talk to a therapist about the sort of thing try to see like what it's like from that perspective and
Actually like right before this I was like being like huh
What if I went to Ash and like talk to a therapist there
I think that could be a fun time
Have you ever thought about like
I guess this can like bring us to our next like
Kind of headspace conversation
I
Have you ever saw out like professional help
That's the thing I think for me but it wasn't high school was that
Until like sophomore year I'd say I really didn't truly have like
Healthy outlet for stress
Because I know that for me
Something that it was like
One time I was like really stressed out by assignment and like
Not turning it in and everything I don't know what it was but like
I broke down in tears in one of my English classes in 10th Grade and that prompted
Them to talk
So like about the professional stress counselor
In my high school
And
Resources
And I think
What would that help
To learn Mr ianora if you're if you're listening to this probably not but you were you are a true homie I feel like
Talking to him it helped me like just get a nice perspective of like
What does it mean to be truly
Like
At peace with
And I find that especially now like
Some people that I've talked to they say how
I am the most anxious person they've ever met which I feel what do you think
Like I found that
So interesting because I feel like
Except for that person who says that I'm like
Super uptight and I just
I don't know
I feel like
Part of it could be that like
I still haven't found a way to release my anxiety Maybe
Like it leeches on to other people but
I don't know I'd like to think that I'm laid back
No I think you are pretty laid back
And I think like for me like okay personally like
I'm super anxious and
I just can't help it you know what I mean like
I know everything is fine
But my
Just has this like innate response to like
Tournament you change
They even just like
I guess test anxiety is a little different because
The first
Going to feel a little
Are you done a good job but outside of school like
Like for example moving into galey Heights immense amounts of like shirts
Like I was like
Like even like the first few nights there I can't like waking up in the middle of the night
It just like being like
Worried about something I didn't
Anything you're worried about
That's that's interesting cuz I know for me like
Moving into the apartment I really just feel like oh
I'm just
Moving into the apartment
I really didn't feel anything besides that
I think also like
So
For people who are like
Don't really know us like don't really know me or maybe like
I don't know who would
Until this that doesn't really know who Matt is but
Like this past month like we really struggled
It's like
Whether or not we should renew our lease yeah this year okay that
Even for me like
I thought was stre
Was that stressful that was definitely I think for me
That feels stressful because
That I feel like a big part of thing was that
No matter what choice we made
Someone would end up getting hurt and that fee and that feeling
It's just
It just you just get this feeling of a sense of dread because
It's like I hope I didn't burn any Bridges
And I just know that like
My relationship with other people might have been slightly tainted by it by these decisions I think so too like the same exact
It's
Hard when you know that
Or your decision is going to have impact on someone that you really like
And
Yeah it was it was like tough I mean I was stressed out
Like something I've heard is that
I am I can be a bit of a people pleaser at times or trying to make everyone happy
But I think
That's not necessarily
Bad thing because I know for me like
The way that I drive happiness
Is partly like from
Having other people be happy
I feel like
If I'm able to make a positive impact on someone's life
Gives me a sense of peace
And I think that like
They're having this feeling of being a negative
Like forcing someone's life that just
It gives me stress I just I don't want to have
I don't want people to impart negative feelings or like
Have negative feelings because of me
But that's at the same time this can be really draining I had a friend
Was pretty similar to this where she always tried
To make everyone happy
But the problem was
Does she never had the time to I guess
Care for herself
And it really led to like I guess not really a breakdown but just like
Need a sense of needing to reevaluate once priorities
Life is stressful I mean like there's nothing we can really do to avoid it but
Maybe the way that we like cope
Just
The change and that's why I like
P**** got professional help right like
I can't help that my body like feels this way
About like certain things or that like my mind
To over
By
Like there are different ways
So we could like
More healthy way
And we can turn into like people talk about training deposit energy I don't really know if I believe in that but I think we can just have to accept life
But
You know
I do
Hope that like one day down the line I won't feel
So
Anxious about like the smallest
I think now it's just because like you know like
The direct imp
It's a lot of like what
And so
I think
Needing to
Take time
Like for example we kind of figure out the
You stay like kind of lost it was just very last night
All parties involved this is all parties involved
But you know what see here we are now we're sitting in the hammock
Hopefully not 16 1715
Specifically
We should start
I'm going to
Jenny though
Like yeah I feel like she
Because so that's the thing like our apartment is also made this chart of like
How is everyone on the scale from introvert to extrovert and quiet to loud and Jenny if you speak if you're listening to this you are
Extrovert loud
She's not that extroverted but I think like
The stuff that she says is like
Even though
I haven't known her for that long I feel like we've been friends forever
Success with sever
Earlier
Just to capture the memory honestly yeah I kind of
I kind of want to have Jenny on as a guest one time because I feel like she has the thing is that
She has a lot of
She like has a lot of thoughts on things but I feel like it's really nice and
Sometimes it's good it's a good perspective especially cuz like
I don't hear this sort of things and it's
I guess it's just it's interesting
Everyone's so interesting
Who do you think
You'll have on the podcast next
The podcast
That's a good question I think what it is that it was your free floating thing I don't know it's going to be next I just know that next week is going to be
The Valentine's Day special Valentine's week specials
What
You'll be tuning in fun times
The podcast by talking about because I have to go and probably
I know I can leave
In like 7
Yeah but
We should talk about like future
Like
Aspirations
What we're looking forward
Well end on a posit
Positive no yeah I feel like because
This this podcast I feel like it's has it supposed to shares of
Positive negatives and I agree let's end with a positive note do you have any
Main things that you're looking forward to you
Listen to More
Words of your podcast
Yay
Yes
I'm looking forward to spending more
Time
With everyone in the apartment I think like
Fall quarter we were a really on the grind like I thought we didn't really bond that much cuz everyone was just so busy
But
I think like making time like for example this is really like the first time that and
I've decided to have like a prolonged child conversation
I really glad that we set aside time to do this
Yeah because I feel like the most important thing
As I said before
What I like
And I guess
Relation to people is that like I feel like you're as much easier
To like connect people on 10
Because I used to be a group
I used to be a group person but now I think
I'm learning like
The importance of being able to talk to someone one-on-one
And yeah and I guess also as well
For my thoughts on the future a big reason why I wanted to do this podcasting as well is because I kind of wanted
A way to look back and reflect on what my thoughts are
And any given moment and I feel like
Hopefully I look back on this and it's going to be
Positives

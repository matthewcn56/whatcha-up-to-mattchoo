Baby you should come on over, we could see it through you take me high   We can talk about nothin' or we can see what it's like You′re the only one I would fall for I feel like I'm wastin' time, Tryna find where you are Together chasing waves, It's the day for you and I Rainbow completed in all different colors We got no interruptions and we both feelin' the vibe I ain’t got no ride, but I got that rhythm babe I may seem flashy on the outside but I’m still afraid I don’t need a lot to come to your way Even when hurtful words stab me, I smile again cuz you’re there I'm kinda shy I don't look it, I saw the chance and I took it I know love it is such a funny thing. A mystery allure, gotta get to know you more I could never find the right way to tell you I could never find the right way to tell you I ain’t got no ride, but I got that rhythm babe why do you long for love Speakers without music are meaningless, a phone with no battery has no use I ain't seeing no lies, look here, I'm the highlight I crossed the ocean of my mind, My wounds are healing with the salt Maybe I'm sick of sleeping longer nights with lesser feelings I crossed the ocean of my mind, My wounds are healing with the salt Fuck it, you just freak out, playing with my feelings they say it’s sweet like candy, they say it feels like flying To be updated!
